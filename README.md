# First Project in Odin 

Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website created using html.

To do this one must be able to do the following in HTML:

1. Be able to link images.
2. Be able to write paragraphs.
3. Be able to create ordered and non ordered lists

Takeaways : It was fun for a first subject, As long as you really try to understand the lessons in TOP you would swiftly be able to do this. Doing commits was fun too! Though it was much more convenient for me to do commits on the vscode rather than on manually doing it in the terminal. To more projects ahead!
